## Updating from v1 to v2

Version 2 of the HTTP package started to use PSR-7 compliant packages. This means that custom transport drivers now need to formulate
their `Response` object using PSR-7 compliant syntax.

`
$response = new \Joomla\Http\Response;
$response->withBody($body);
$response->withHeader($headerName, $headerValue);
$response->withStatus($statusCode);
`

We encourage users of the package to use PSR-7 compliant code to retrieve information from the response object, however we are maintaining
support for retrieving the body, headers and status code through the same way as in version 1 of the HTTP package.
